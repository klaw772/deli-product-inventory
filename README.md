This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Welcome to the Deli Product Inventory!

This app was created to contribute to the supermarket/deli industry, where employees handling orders for the store can view what is currently available, as well as add any new products that are coming in. Additionally, customers can view the list of products prior to entering the store for a faster and more seamless experience.
